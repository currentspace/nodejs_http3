# Configuration Options Reference

This reference covers the public configuration types exposed by
`@currentspace/http3`.

Defaults below reflect the current runtime behavior in the JS wrappers and
native config builders. Where a field is optional and there is no internal
fallback, the default is listed as `none`.

For deployment/runtime guidance, see [`RUNTIME_MODES.md`](./RUNTIME_MODES.md).

## `TlsOptions`

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `string \| Buffer` | `none` | PEM-encoded private key. Required unless `pfx` is provided. |
